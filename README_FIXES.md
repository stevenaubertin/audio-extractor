# README.md Inconsistencies Found and Fixed

## üîç Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ **Missing Key Feature Information**
**Issue**: Features section didn't highlight millisecond precision as a key feature  
**Fix**: Updated to emphasize "Time range extraction with millisecond precision - Extract specific segments with 1ms accuracy"

### 2. ‚úÖ **Missing Test Suite Information**  
**Issue**: No mention of the comprehensive test suite that was added
**Fix**: Added "Comprehensive test suite - 44+ tests covering all functionality" to features

### 3. ‚úÖ **Installation Steps Missing Testing**
**Issue**: Installation section didn't include optional test verification step
**Fix**: Added step 5 with test running instructions for verifying installation

### 4. ‚úÖ **Missing Test Documentation in Usage**
**Issue**: Usage section had no information about running tests
**Fix**: Added comprehensive "Run tests" section with all test commands

### 5. ‚úÖ **Incomplete File Naming Examples**
**Issue**: File naming examples didn't show how millisecond precision affects naming
**Fix**: Added example: `video_123456_d30250.mp3` (from 1:23.456 for 30.250 seconds with milliseconds)

### 6. ‚úÖ **Missing Dedicated Testing Section**
**Issue**: No dedicated section explaining the test framework
**Fix**: Added comprehensive "Testing" section with:
- Quick testing instructions (no dependencies required)
- Test coverage breakdown (44/44 core tests passing)
- Test organization explanation
- File descriptions for each test suite

### 7. ‚úÖ **Command Syntax Consistency**
**Issue**: Verified that all command examples use consistent syntax (global options before commands)
**Status**: Already consistent - no changes needed

## üìä Summary of Changes

| Section | Change Type | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Features | Enhancement | Added millisecond precision and test suite highlights |
| Installation | Addition | Added optional test verification step |
| Usage | Addition | Added "Run tests" section |
| File Naming | Enhancement | Added millisecond precision naming example |
| New Section | Addition | Added comprehensive "Testing" section |

## ‚úÖ Current Status

The README.md now provides:
- **Complete feature overview** including millisecond precision
- **Comprehensive installation guide** with test verification
- **Detailed usage instructions** including test commands  
- **Complete testing documentation** for all test suites
- **Accurate file naming conventions** including millisecond examples
- **Consistent command syntax** throughout all examples

All major inconsistencies have been identified and resolved. The README now accurately reflects the current state of the project with its millisecond precision feature and comprehensive test suite.
